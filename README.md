# Delivery Performance & Customer Satisfaction Analysis

This project analyzes delivery performance and customer satisfaction using e-commerce order data. The goal is to identify patterns in late deliveries, understand their patterns across categories, and evaluate their impact on customer review scores.

---

## Key Questions

- What percentage of orders are delivered **late vs. on time**?
- Which **product categories** have the highest late delivery rate?
- How much does **lateness impact review scores**?

## Project Overview

I worked with the **Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset by Olist** to explore delivery performance and its effect on customer satisfaction. Using SQL, I:

- Classified orders as `on time` or `late` based on actual vs. estimated delivery dates.
- Calculated late delivery rates by product category.
- Investigated how late deliveries correlate with review scores, including year-over-year trends.

Some key observations:

- Approximately **8% of orders** were delivered late.
- Categories like **home_comfort_2** and **furniture_mattress_and_upholstery** had the highest late rates.
- Orders with a **1-star review** had a much higher late rate (~37%), while **5-star reviews** had a late rate around 3%, showing a strong correlation between timeliness and customer satisfaction.

## SQL script is included in this repository

A **Tableau dashboard** has been created to visualize key insights from the analysis. The dashboard includes:

- Percentage of late vs. on-time orders.
- Late delivery rates across product categories.
- Correlation between delivery timeliness and review scores.
- Year-over-year trends in delivery performance and customer satisfaction.
